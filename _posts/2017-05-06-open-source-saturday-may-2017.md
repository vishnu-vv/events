About Open Source Saturday
---------------------------

Open Source Saturday is a program organised by Red Panthers and Kerala Ruby User Group on first Saturday of every month. The aim of this program is to encourage more developers and students in and around Kochi to contribute to Open Source Software through code contributions.

The general template of the event is to gather at a venue and we spend the whole day solving issues and bugs reported in an open source project. The most popular language during this event is Ruby as the host company, Red Panthers, is a Ruby on Rails development specialist. But people are welcomed to work on any open source project they feel like.

Over the past year, since the event has started to be organised in Kochi, over 30+ people have made their first-time contribution to open source through this event. We are hoping that in the coming year more people will start making more code contributions to the open-source community.
